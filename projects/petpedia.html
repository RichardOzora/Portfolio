            <p class="text-lg">PetPedia is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate buying and selling pets, as well as pet-related products like food, toys, and accessories. The platform enables users to browse and find their favorite pets, view items in their cart, and explore various options. An admin panel is included, allowing administrators to log in, manage items, add new products, and oversee all listings.
                <br><br>
                The frontend of PetPedia is built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, while the backend is powered by Node.js with MongoDB as the database. Although the project is not fully complete (e.g., features for buying pet food and toys are still in development), it has been an invaluable learning experience. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of React, database management, and backend development, making it a significant step in improving my web development skills.</p>
